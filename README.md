## Background
In many businesses, identifying which customers will make a purchase (and when) and how much will they spend, is a critical exercise. This is true for both brick-and-mortar outlets and online stores.

## Data 
The data provided in this challenge is website traffic data acquired from an online retailer which collected by our professor **Dr. Charles Nicholson** 

## The Challenge: Predict total sales
The data provides information on customer's website site visit behavior. Customers may visit the store multiple times, on multiple days, with or without making a purchase. The goal is to predict how much sales revenue can be expected from each customer. The variable **revenue** lists the amount of money that a customer spends on a given visit. The goal is to predict how much money a customer will spend, in total, across all visits to the site, during the allotted one-year time frame (August 2016 to August 2017).
